# Hate-Speech-Reserach-Paper

Machine learning algorithms can be used to detect hate speech. These algorithms can analyze text and 
identify hate speech. They can also be used to determine the tone of a text. This can be used to identify 
hate speech that is disguised as jokes or sarcasm. 

Based on machine learning technique called logistic regression, I will train the algorithm 
to classify hate speech using the data extracted, however machine learning algorithms that can 
be used to detect hate speech include Naïve Bayes, Support Vector machines, extreme gradient 
boosting, multi-layer perception, long – short term memory networks.

The hate speech detection datasets are usually not clean, so they need to be preprocessed
before classification algorithms can be applied and that can detect hate speech in them.
Different machine learning models have different strengths that make some algorithms better
than others for certain tasks such as detecting hate speech. Some models are more accurate 
while others are more efficient. 

Due to wide spread of hate speech over the internet there is a need to study automatic 
detection of hate speech. By automating its detection, the spread of hateful content can be 
reduced.
